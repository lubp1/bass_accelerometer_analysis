# Bass Accelerometer Analysis
This project's objective is to analyze eletric bass playing techniques through the movements of the bass player. The player's plucking hand movements will be captured with an accelerometer on his arm, and the data will be analysed, trying to discover which playing technique is the player using.

This is my undergraduation completion project, on Computer Engineering at FEEC/Unicamp, under guidance of Prof. Dr. Tiago Tavares (https://github.com/tiagoft)
